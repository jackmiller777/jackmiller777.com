	<h2>LEARN ABOUT ME WITH MY AI</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">
			Before you scroll down to my ABOUT ME section, consider using the AI in the bottom right corner of your screen. It works best with Chrome, so if you can't see it, too bad. The bot is pretty self-explanatory, but if you don't know what to ask, ask that. Nearly all the information on this website and more can be found by asking it questions. I built this bot using DialogFlow. Try it!

		  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<div id="aboutme">
		<p style="font-size:17px;">Like other members of the Paranthropus genus, P. boisei is characterized by a specialized skull with adaptations for heavy chewing. A strong sagittal crest on the midline of the top of the skull anchored the temporalis muscles (large chewing muscles) from the top and side of the braincase to the lower jaw, and thus moved the massive jaw up and down. The force was focused on the large cheek teeth (molars and premolars). Flaring cheekbones gave P. boisei a very wide and dish-shaped face, creating a larger opening for bigger jaw muscles to pass through and support massive cheek teeth four times the size of a modern human’s. This species had even larger cheek teeth than P.</p>

		<p><strong>History of Discovery:</strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Year of Discovery:</strong> 1959</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p> 
Paleoanthropologists actually found the first fossils belonging to P. boisei in 1955, but it wasn’t until Mary Leakey’s 1959 discovery of the ‘Zinj’ skull (OH 5) that scientists knew what they had found was a new species. ‘Zinj’ became the type specimen for P. boisei and, soon after, arguably the most famous early human fossil from Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania.</p>

      <p><strong>Weight:</strong> Males: average 108 lbs (49 kg); Females: average 75 lbs (34 kg) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> Below are some of the still unanswered questions about P. boisei that may be answered with future discoveries: </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What, specifically, did P. boisei eat? The morphology and microwear of their teeth indicate different things.</li>
<li>Did P. boisei use stone tools? While we don’t think they did, P. boisei individuals have been found in stratigraphic layers with tools, and also with Homo specimens who often made tools, so there’s always a possibility.</li>
<li>What was the advantage of the big jaws and teeth of P. boisei?</li>
<li>These early humans flourished for a million years, over four times as long as our own species Homo sapiens have been around, and then went extinct---why? Scientists have one prevailing hypothesis: P. boisei was unable to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.  When Earth’s climate intense irregular with fluctuating hot and cold spells, there may have been changes in the proportions of food resources available to P. boisei.  Certain plants could have dwindled or died out. A species’ ability to adapt to changing resources, like food, is critical to their survival. Was highly specialized P. boisei unable to adapt if some of their favored plant foods disappeared due to climatic changes?</li>
